# Prediction-of-Gold-price_-ML_Regression



Here's my second project in Machine Learning for regression problems.
 
The objectives are:
1. To build a machine learning system that can predict GLD (gold) prices based on several other stock prices.
2. Obtain data insights using pandas.
3. Find the correlation of the other features with GLD (gold) stock price.
4. Predict the GLD (gold) price by splitting the data and evaluate the model.

Steps involved are:
Data Collection
Preprocessing
EDA
Model Selection and Training
Model Evaluation
Hyperparameter Tuning


Model was build using Linear Regression, XGB Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Random Forest etc. 
With highest r2_score(0.9895) and lowest values of mean absolute error(1.1362) and mean squared error(3.6556) ,Random Forest has been finalized as the best model for this project.
